## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Mock-Markets is developed using HTML for structuring the web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for handling user interactions and dynamic behavior. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Mock-Markets offers a seamless and engaging user experience. HTML provides the structure, CSS enhances the visual appeal, and JavaScript brings life to the application by adding interactivity and real-time data updates.

## Lessons Learned

During the development of Mock-Markets, I had the opportunity to explore new technologies and APIs, which led to significant learning experiences. Here are some key lessons I gained from working on this project.

### Learning Chart.js for Data Visualization

One of the highlights of this project was my introduction to Chart.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive and visually appealing charts. As I integrated Chart.js into Mock-Markets to display market data trends and portfolio performance, I discovered the importance of effective data visualization in conveying information to users.

I learned how to create various chart types, customize their appearance, and dynamically update them with real-time data. This experience deepened my understanding of data visualization techniques and enhanced my ability to present complex information in an accessible and engaging manner.

### Working with the CoinGecko API

By reading and understanding the CoinGecko API documentation, I gained valuable insights into working with external APIs and retrieving real-time market data. It taught me how to construct API requests, handle responses, and parse JSON data effectively.

The documentation emphasized the importance of error handling, data validation, and sanitization, ensuring reliable and secure data integration. This experience expanded my knowledge of API integration and reinforced the significance of leveraging external data sources in web applications.

### Code Separation for Maintainability and Readability

While developing Mock-Markets, I initially did not prioritize code separation and organization. However, through this experience, I quickly realized the importance of keeping code modular and organized for maintainability and readability.

As the project grew in complexity, I encountered difficulties in managing and understanding the codebase. This realization prompted me to reevaluate my approach and implement a more structured and modular architecture for future projects.

By separating the codebase into reusable components and modules, I can achieve clearer code organization, easier debugging, and improved collaboration with other team members. This experience taught me the value of code separation and organization, and I will prioritize modular design principles and best practices to create more maintainable and readable codebases in the future.
